# Spacing & Layout

Our layout and spacing system is designed for creative expression, visual rhythm, and dynamic impact. We use a deliberate, asymmetrical spacing scale and a creative grid to ensure content inspires imagination while maintaining professional structure.

**Spacing Scale:**
- Uses an 8px base for intentional creative tension
- Dynamic spacing ratios inspired by the golden ratio (1:1.618)
- Varied spacing to create visual interest and guide the eye
- Responsive adjustments for all device sizes

**Grid System:**
- Dynamic, asymmetrical layouts that break conventional patterns
- Creative use of negative space to frame important elements
- Deliberate grid-breaking elements that showcase originality

**Guidelines:**
- Use whitespace as a creative element, not just a separator
- Create intentional focal points through spacing contrast
- Allow key elements to "breathe" while creating dynamic relationships
- Implement deliberate rhythm through spacing variation
